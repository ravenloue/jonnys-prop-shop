## Overview

### The challenge

This project will be combining several things I have learned so far with new challenges. I'm going to learn to use the instagram API and build a custom blog.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- React JS 
  - (create react app)
- SCSS

### What I learned

So far I have learned how to make a hamburger menu that toggles the navbar component, and set up icons that shrink and grow with the size of the browser window. Hopefully this looks good on mobile, but its just a temporary fix. 

### Continued development

So far the landing page is the only portion completed, I still have the following to work on:
- [] About Me
- [] Instagram Gallery
- [] Custom Blog
- [] Diorama page
- [] Future shop page
- [] Footer
